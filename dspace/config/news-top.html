<h2>UBC STATSpace is Live!</h2>

<p>
    STATSpace is open education resource repository created as part of
    the Statistics Flexible Learning Project at the University of
    British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The project is made up of
    faculty and staff across UBC involved in the development of
    educational material that target conceptually challenging topics
    in introductory statistics. STATSpace is our platform for bringing
    together high-quality intro stats resources from UBC and around
    the world. We aim to create a sustainable environment for
    supporting cooperation and sharing of statistics instruction
    expertise and resources to address the challenges of educators and
    the needs of learners.
